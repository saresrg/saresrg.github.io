We agreed to assume ownership of the W6AMT, 440 repeater on Crystal Peak. The repeater is considered by the group to be \"an extended range\" SARES repeater. Due to the problems with south county ARES / RACES being able to contact outside there area, this repeater is a good fix for them. Therefore this will be a cooperative effort with the Garlic Valley Amateur Radio Club (GVARC). We must still work out the funding implications with GVARC. SARES-RG has agreed that the repeater will be open for all to use, as well as a county resource as needed. A member of the SARES-RG will be the official repeater trustee and one control operator (at least), GVARC will also have control operator ability.</p> <p>We agreed to obtain a supplemental power source to retain the logic in the repeater equipment during any possible momentary power interruptions, as opposed as having a more robust system for the 30 or so seconds between power loss and generator takeover.</p> <p>We will be sending the current repeater trustee a letter acknowledging acceptance of the equipment and requesting there signature agreeing to the transfer.
